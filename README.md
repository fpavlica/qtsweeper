# Qtsweeper

Qtsweeper is a minesweeper-type game I made over the past few days to learn Qt and brush up on my C++, 
and to have something to show on my github account. It probably took less than 20 hours overall.

## Features

A basic playable minesweeper game on an 8x10 grid with 10 mines hidden. 

The game is designed to have a cool dark blue colour scheme to make it look somewhat different from the original game. 
All icons were made by myself.

## Missing features

This game is clearly not very polished, and it is not meant to be â€“ 
this was more of a coding exercise than an attempt at creating a full-fledged game.

Currently it does not support resizing the window, changing the size of the grid or the number of mines hidden 
(though the code is set up to handle this feature when a settings menu is added to the UI). 
There is no timer or scoreboard.
